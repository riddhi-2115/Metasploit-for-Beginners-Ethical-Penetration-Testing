# Metasploit-for-Beginners-Ethical-Penetration-Testing

##Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to equip learners with practical, hands-on experience in using Metasploit for ethical penetration testing. 

- Understand Metasploit Framework: Gain comprehensive knowledge of the Metasploit Framework, its architecture, and how to use it effectively for penetration testing.
- Conduct Network Scanning: Utilize Nmap and other tools to perform network discovery, identify open ports, and map potential vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- Exploit Vulnerabilities: Apply learned techniques to identify and exploit security weaknesses in designated target systems ethically and safely.
- Report and Remediate: Develop skills to document findings, create detailed vulnerability assessments, and suggest remediation strategies to improve system security.
